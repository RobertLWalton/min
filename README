MIN is a runtime system that provides support for
programming languages.

MIN might best be described as a `minimal complete'
runtime system.  It has a number of advanced features,
such as support for objects that combine a vector with
a hash table, support for an ephemeral real-time garbage
collector, and advanced printing support.
